					<h1>Release It!</h1>
					<h3>by Michael T. Nygard</h3>
					<p>
						Releasing (enterprise-grade) software.

					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>So, Release it!. A book by Michael T. Nygard. It's quite a long read so I'll try to spare you the time and cherry-pick some - what I think are - important views. Apart from some cautionary tails and some anekdotes, Michael has devided his book into four parts: [walk trough them].</p>

					<h2>The book</h2>
					<ol>

 -->
						<p>Since we're not over-capacity yet, I'll skip the capacity part. The General Design issues are, in my humble opinion, not our problem. Micheal describes issues for the more "classic" companies. Operations is something we could improve on greatly, but I think that operations is suitable for now and we're already improving on that subject.</p>

						<p>That leaves us with stability. Even though there seems to be some confidence about releasing new features, I myself cringe when confronted with a (sometimes stupid) little bug that brings our software to a grinding halt.
						Take weekly-email-gate for example. Therefore I want to share some of the views of Michael about stability with you.

						</ol>

					<aside class="notes">Allright. I'll continue by `defining` stability; from there I'll discuss some of the patterns and anti-patterns described in the book; and while we're on the subject I'll try to <em>put my finger on the sore spot!</em></aside>

						<h3>Stable software</h3>
						<p>Being able to get work done.</p>
						<p class='fragment'>In our case, that means: planning trips.</p>
						<aside class='notes'>Michael eventually defines stability as "even when the <i>system</i> is under stress, users can still get work done."</aside>

						<h2>1. Stable software</h2>
						<p>Availability</p>
						<img src='uptime.png' />
						<aside class='notes'>To be able to get work done, the system must be available. This month was not too bad. But this is overall availablilty. We had some degrated performance this month as well. Some work could be done; other work coudn't.</aside>

				<section id='part-two'>
					<h2>Part 2 & 3<h2>
					<h3>Patterns and anti-patterns</h3>
					<p>My pick of the litter.</p>
					<p>3 Anti-patterns and 4 Patterns.</p>
					<aside class='notes'>I'll try not to go into too much detail; Michael describes a good total of 19 stability patterns and anti-patterns. I'll pick a few that are either important or can yield quick results. So this is part 2 and 3 together, because I will evaluate Go About during my introduction into the various patterns.</aside>

					<section class='fragments' id='integration-points'>
						<h2>Anti-pattern 1</h2>
						<h3>Integration points</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>Calls to the outside</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Internal calls as well! (OTP, ElasticSearch, Database)</li>
							<li class='fragment'>But even inside Planner+ (Resources calling Services)</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Most connectors will wait indefinitely for a response!</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Failing fast is better.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class='notes'>
							<p><em>[fragment first 2]</em> Both calls to the outside as well as some internal calls could be considered integration points. Those are pretty easy to identify, since they are separated by some sort of socket. (Mainly HTTP).</p>
							<p><em>[fragment]</em>Even internal calls that make use of different parts of the system could be indicated as integration points.</p>
							<p><em>[fragment]</em>Many connectors, even the default http-connector from Java, do not have a default timeout.</p>
							<p><em>[fragment]</em>But even those who do have a timeout, have a typical timeout of 30 seconds. Which is way too long to wait for an error: it is better to fail fast than a slow response, especially when it is a slow fail. Both because it causes user-frustration and because the system occupies resources, that otherwise could be used to process other requests.</p>

						<h2>Anti-pattern 3</h4>
						<h3>SLA Inversion</h3>

						<p>SLA's cascade: if all of the services we use guarantee 99,9% then our maximum will ever be about 99,5%<p>
						<p class='fragment'>We should decouple our SLA guarantees</p>
						<aside class='notes'>This one is in here for the managers under us :-).</aside>

							<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Examine dependencies</li>
							<li><span class='fragment checkmark'></span>Decoupled SLA</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class='notes'>Empty promises? You tell me :-) But I do think we didn't carefully examine our dependencies. Realtime results? locatienet? We did - however - decoupled our SLA. That is; in the contract with Veolia, the only numbers that were given were about network, hardware and power availability.</aside>

				<section class='fragments' id='timeouts'>
					<h2>Pattern 1</h2>
					<h3>Timeouts</h3>
					<ul class='score'>
						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Apply timeouts to integration points</li>

						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Delayed retries (exp. backoff)</li>
						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Count!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class='notes'><p>Apply timeouts to anything that we don't have direct control over. From the code's point of view. So that means database-connections, calls to libraries, IO-wait, etc.</p>
					<p>When something is taking too long; we don't always care why: we just need to give up for now.</p>
					<p>When something is important, backoff exponentially. Retry immediately, then a second, then 2 etc.. Every time it fails, increase waiting time exponentially. Last but not least: count how many times a timeout occurs.</p>

					<h2>Pattern 2</h2>
					<h3>Circuit breaker</h3>
					<ul class='score'>
						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Stop calling if it's broken</li>
						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Combine with timeouts</li>
						<li><span class='fragment fail'></span>Report! (pager-duty, statuspage)</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class='notes'><p>Circuit breakers allow us to switch off certain parts of Go About. The Circuit breakers patterns would allow for both automatically and manually tripping the breaker.</p> 
						<p>Don't call if it doesn't work: like with the weekly-email.</p>
						<p>If combined with timeouts, you'd be able to automatically trip a breaker</p>
						<p>A tripped circuit-breaker means degraded performance. It needs to be reported somehwere</p>
					</aside>

				<section class='fragments' id='steady-state'>
					<h2>Pattern 3</h2>
					<h3>Steady State</h3>
					<ul class='score'>
						<li><span class='fragment checkmark'></span>Avoid fiddling</li>
						<li><span class='fragment checkmark'></span>Purge data with application logic</li>
						<li><span class='fragment checkmark'></span>Limit caching</li>
						<li><span class='fragment checkmark'></span>Roll the logs</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>Steady stateAnything that gathers data will eventually clog. Clean up after anything that collects anything. We were not up to par a while ago, where logs would fill the filesystem and where the amount of saved trips with Large-object data in the database clogged the pipes. But we're doing better now.</p>

						<p>Avoid needing frequent human interaction; like with our Request-Log. It should've been turned off way sooner than we did. But now we don't have any need for repeated human-interaction anymore.</p>
						<p>Purge data with app-logic; like our cleanup jobs for not-selected trips.</p>
						<p>Limit caching: we don't use real caches yet. Checkmark!</p>
						<p>Roll the logs: we send stuff to external services, logs itself are rolled. We're in the clear</p>
				</section>
				<section class='fragments' id='fail-fast'>
					<h2>Pattern 4</h2>
					<h3>Fail Fast</h3>
					<ul class='score'>
						<li><span class='fragment partially'></span>Avoid slow response: fail fast</li>
